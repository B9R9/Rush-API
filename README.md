# Music collection rush

The objective of this rush is to build a tool  in 2 days (or series of tools) that will allow a Spotify or Deezer user to download a list of their saved albums, and print them out as a nice looking catalog. Your tool only needs to support one of the services.
You can use the languages, libraries, frameworks or tools of your choice. The focus of this exercise is functionality and quality of the end product, rather than the tools’ user interface.

## Mandatory

Display all the user’s saved albums with (at least):
* Cover picture 
* Title
* Artist(s)
* Year
* Track listing
Your tool should produce a document (or documents) in the format of
your choice, that can be browsed easily and printed out
